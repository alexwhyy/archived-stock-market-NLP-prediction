# archived-stock-market-NLP-prediction
Our school had a stock market prediction challenge. I tried to get ahead by building NLP prediction engine and hacked something together in a few days.

Currently, it runs word2vec on a csv of r/worldnews data with word2vec using Magnitude. It might take some debugging to get all of this running on your computer. I know, the code is terrible, I'm still learning.
